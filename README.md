# lotto

## How to Compile
- [Install go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Check out the code to **$GOPATH/src/github.com/johnnytshi/lotto**, *GOPATH normally points to **~/go** on Mac / Linux*
- Run **go run main.go** to run the main program

## How to Run Unit Tests
- Go into the **processor** folder
- Run **go test -v**

NOTE: I've also included 3 binaries files in the **bin** folder, one for each platform
